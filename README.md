# phase-3-week-1-code-challenge
This project contains implementations of various Python functions and a class. Below is a description of each function and class, explaining what it does.

# 1. functions.py
# Python Functions Assessment

This repository contains solutions for a Python functions assessment.

## Functions

- `add_numbers(num1, num2)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `is_even(number)`: Returns True if the number is even, False otherwise.
- `reverse_string(text)`: Returns the reversed version of the input string.
- `count_vowels(text)`: Returns the count of vowels in the input string.
- `calculate_factorial(n)`: Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- `apply_decorator(func)`: Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied".

## Additional Functions

- `sort_by_age(list_of_tuples)`: Sorts a list of tuples by age.
- `merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)`: Merges two dictionaries, summing up values for common keys.

## Class

- `Car`: A class with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method `display_info()` to print car details.

## Setup

Clone the repository and add your code files. Ensure all functions and class are tested.

Ensure Python 3 is Installed:

You can check if Python 3 is installed by running:

bash
Copy code
python3 --version
If not installed, download and install Python 3 from python.org.

## Run the Python Code:

Save your Python code in a file named functions.py or similar. To execute the script, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 functions.py
This will run the Python script using Python 3. Ensure that your code is correctly implemented and tested before running.

## Testing
Test each function and class method to ensure they work as expected. You can write separate test scripts or use a testing framework such as unittest or pytest.
